To build container:

	make

This will automatically pull down the centos:7 container, 
and install all of the things.

lw-plack-app-provision-server is cloned into /usr/local/lp/git


To start the container, execute run.sh in this directory.
It exports port 5000, mapped to port 5000 of the host.


The main "lw" repo is mounted into the container from your home
directory into /usr/local/lp/git/lw: i.e. $HOME/lw

Also, if $HOME/lwconfigs exists, that is mounted as /usr/local/lp/configs,
otherwise it will mount /usr/local/lp/configs of the parent host.
